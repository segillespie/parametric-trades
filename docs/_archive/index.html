<h2>About</h2>
<h3 style = 'text-align:center;'><a href="/DOE_Overview_Presentation.html"> Course Overview Presentation </a></h3>
<p>This course was developed by analysts at TRAC Fort Leavenworth with assistance
from the <a href = 'https://www.dscoe.org'>Data Science Center of Education (DSCOE)</a>
and friends and peers throughout the Army analytic community.  It is intended to
serve as a practical foundation in the statistical field of the design and analysis
of experiments, specifically focused on supporting simulation development and analysis.
It assumes basic familiarity with statistics and introduces programming in
<a href = "https://www.r-project.org/about.html"><i>R</i></a>.  It is intended to be self paced, though organizations
can work through it on a set schedule as desired.</p>

<h2>Community</h2>
<p>One of the goals of this project is to cultivate the analytic community focused
on simulation and the design and analysis of experiments. At a future point, we
will develop a means for posing questions, sharing ideas, and innovation.

<h2> Additional Resources </h2>
<p> There are many resources available for support in statistics, simulation,
  and programming.  Here are a few that you might not immediately find on google:
  <ul>
    <li> <a href = "https://www.dscoe.org">DSCOE</a></li>
    <li> <a href = "https://my.nps.edu/web/seed">Naval Postgraduate School SEED Center</a> - Note this is a
    highly useful resource for "data farming" - i.e., building and analyzing simulations.</li>
    <li> <a href = "https://www.afit.edu/STAT/"></a>The Air Force Institute of Technology Scientific Test & Analysis Techniques (STAT) Center of Excellence</li> - Note, this center is focused primarily on test and evaluation, but has a great wealth of DOE resources. 
    <li> <a href = "https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/">NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook of Statistical Methods</a></li> - This is a useful engineering statistics handbook produced by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), particularly, for this course, their <a href = "https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pri/pri.htm">Chapter 5 - Process Improvement</a>.
    <li> <a href = "https://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R for Data Science</a> by Grolemund and Wickham</li>
    <li> <a href = "https://bookdown.org">Bookdown</a> has a variety of free books related to R, data visualization, and statistics.</li>
    <li> <a href = "http://www.biostathandbook.com/">Bio Stat Handbook</a> is a nice statistics resource.</li>
    <li> <a href = "https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/">Statistics How To is a nice statistics resource.
